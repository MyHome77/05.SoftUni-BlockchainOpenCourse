# 05.SoftUni-BlockchainOpenCourse
# Introduction to Blockchain Technology
The course aims to give participants a solid understanding of Blockchain technology. Despite the fact that it covers only intrusive topics around the main technological aspects, economic benefits and the future of Blockchain, details of ICO, DAPP, smart contracts, and cryptography will also be affected so that the course will be a transition to the next two parts of the learning cycle at SoftUni, where the technical details and the necessary programming skills and tools will be explored.


# Smart Contract Development with Solidity
The course "Smart Contract Development with Solidity" builds basic skills for block development of decentralized applications in the Ethereum environment. The main focus is on building smart contracts, which are executed in a decentralized way in the Ehtereum blockchain network.

Decentralized applications are a code that is executed in the decentralized block of the crypto-loop. No one has the power to change the device or its data, and because of the block of essence, no one has the ability to do so. This security and assurance that the app will work exactly the way it is set in the code gives us the ability to easily create applications to handle important tasks. A secure voting system, a decentralized auction, or a separate cryptography are implemented in a few lines of code and posted on the network for seconds.

Participants must have robust basic programming skills (working with data, expressions, contingent constructs, cycles, arrays, lists, associative arrays, classes, methods and events) because the learning content is built upon them.

In the foreseen blocks of study, a smart contract development for the Ethereum blockchain network within the course will cover all the more significant moments from the development and publication of a decentralized Ethereum application: familiarity with the Solidity language: its structure, expressions, control structures, data types , types of functions, events, PLO development, and publishing applications on the Ethereu network, integrating them with other software, optimizing performance, and security code.

During the course, practical block projects such as decentralized DNS, auctioning (decentralized bidding), and building of their own cryptoLight will be developed.

The course ends with development and protection of a practical project (Ethereum smart contract), which covers the study material studied and can have a real practical application in the block network.

The training covers serious programming and blocking topics, so we recommend that you get involved when you have the experience of programming code and a solid understanding of the concepts of blockchain technology.
